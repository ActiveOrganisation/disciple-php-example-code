# disciple-php-example-code

This is a simple example of PHP code for Encrypting and Decrypting Authenticated Links from Disciple Media.
Their documentation is meaningless and irrelevant to anyone actually wanting to utilise the Authenticed Links.
This repository is set up to, hopefully, save other people some time.

1. Disciple Media need to switch on Authenticated Links - Make sure they have actually done this.
2. Disciple Media need to provide you with a SECRET KEY - - This is different to your API Key (not to be confused) - make sure they provide this.
